# Landing Page Project

## What is it?

This is a landing page that represents any data that comes from a news API or any CMS. The whole purpose of the project is to add various animations and go through real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM and making web pages dynamic using only vanilla JavaScript.

### Functionalities added to the page:
* Dynamically build a navigation bar when the DOM is ready and add links to it based on the number of sections
* Make the section closest to the top of the viewport stand out
* Make clicking the anchor tags scroll to the sections, instead of the default behavior
* Add an active state to the navigation items when their associated sections are active as well
* Hide the navigation bar after 5 3 seconds of inactivity
* Add a scroll to the top button that appears when you get past the fold of the page
* Nice project
